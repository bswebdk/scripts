This script is used to create an udev automount rule for a block device. This script
must be run as root (use sudo). The user will be prompted to say Yes or No to the changes
the script will perform. Usage:

  ./uamount.sh block-device [mount-point] [other args]
  
block-device:
  Must be a valid block device which starts with "/dev/", eg "/dev/sda". The defined block
  device must be attached in order to query its UUID.

mount-point:
  If defined it must specify a valid directory name to where the block device will be
  mounted. If the mount point is not an absolute path (eg. /path/to/mount/point) then it
  will be appended to /media" (eg. "usbhdd" becomes "/media/usbhdd". BEWARE: The absolute
  path used as mount point MAY NOT include any blank spaces!
  
  If not defined uamount assumes that you want to perform an un-mount of the specified
  block device. This will eventually remove the entry from fstab, delete the udev rule and
  if user wants it, the mount point will also be removed.

other-args:
  -? | --help          : Show this message.
                        
  -t | --test          : Used to test the script. File "./test.txt" used as fstab directory
                         "./test" used for rule.
                        
  -b | --no-backup     : Do not backup fstab to "fstab_BAK*" where * is an incremental number.
                        
  -r | --no-reload     : Do not reaload udev rules, default when "test" is specified.
  
  -d | --no-delete     : Do not attempt to delete the mounting point. By default the user
                         will be asked if the mounting point should be unmounted (if mounted)
                         and deleted.
                        
  -n | --udev-name     : The name used to create the udev rule, the UUID of the block device
                         will be used if undefinied. The name will always be preceeded by
                         "uamount-", eg. "usbdrive" becomes "uamount-usbdrive".
                        
                         The name used to create an automount must be specified to remove it.
                        
  -p | --udev-priority : Priority for the udev rule, 99 is default.
  
  -y | --yes           : Yes to all questions.
  
  Usage examples:
    
    Automount "/dev/sda" to "/media/MYDRIVE":
      sudo ./uamount.sh /dev/sda MYDRIVE
    
    Remove above automount for "/dev/sda":
      sudo ./uamount.sh /dev/sda
      
    Automount "/dev/sda" to "/media/MYDRIVE" with priority 80 and rule name "mydrive":
      sudo ./uamount.sh /dev/sda MYDRIVE -p 80 -n mydrive
    
    Remove above automount for "/dev/sda" (note that "-p 80 -n mydrive" is required
    here since it is a non default setting):
      sudo ./uamount.sh /dev/sda -p 80 -n mydrive
